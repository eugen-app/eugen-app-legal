# Privacy Policy – Eugen  
Last updated: 22.12.2025

## 1. Controller
The controller within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is:

Anastasia Saize 
Feldstr.68
99326 Stadtilm
Deutschland
E-mail: eugenapp.help@gmail.com

## 2. Scope
This privacy policy applies to the mobile application “Eugen” (Android) and all functions within the app.

## 3. Principle of data processing
The app is designed so that usage-related data is generally processed and stored locally on the user’s device.  
No such data is currently transmitted to servers of the controller.

## 4. Data processed locally on the device
Depending on usage, the app may process the following information locally:

- Information about smoking behavior (e.g. number of cigarettes smoked per day)
- Calculated statistics and savings
- Individual settings (e.g. goals, prices, currency, language, theme)
- Start date and reduction intervals
- Optional mood or daily markers
- Reminder and notification settings

This data is stored exclusively in the local app storage on the device.

## 5. Advertising (Google AdMob)
The app may display advertisements. For this purpose, the service Google AdMob provided by Google Ireland Limited is used.

Google may process data under its own responsibility, in particular:
- Device and usage information
- Interactions with advertisements
- Device identifiers (e.g. advertising ID)

Personalized or non-personalized ads may be displayed depending on device settings, region, and user consent.

**Legal basis:**  
Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in financing the app)  
and, where applicable, Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR (consent)

## 6. Donations
The app offers the option of voluntary donations.  
Payment data is processed exclusively by external payment providers in accordance with their respective privacy policies.

## 7. Notifications
If reminders are activated, the selected time is processed locally on the device.  
No push tokens are transmitted to the controller.

**Legal basis:** Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR (consent)

## 8. Rights of data subjects
Data subjects have the rights under Art. 15–21 GDPR, including the right of access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, and objection.

Note:  
Since most data is stored exclusively on the user’s device, the controller cannot access or provide this data. Data can be deleted via app functions or by uninstalling the app.

## 9. Data security
Appropriate technical and organizational measures are implemented to protect data against unauthorized access. However, absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

## 10. Changes
This privacy policy may be updated if legal requirements or app functionality change. The current version is available at the specified URL.
